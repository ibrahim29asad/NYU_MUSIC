Ibrahim Asad

To run the Project download the Files from LMD-Full at https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/

Then in the same directory run PreProcess.ipynb

Once completed you should have all the files converted

Then run both create_subset_final.py and create_subset.py in the same CD to create test_100MB.txt and test_200MB.txt

Then you git clone https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT

and then create folder under data called music_abc. 

place the Fprepare.py, prepare.py, test_100MB.txt and test_200MB.txtin the nanoGPT/data/music_abc and in the main file nanoGPT.

Once completed cd.. or cd out of the nanoGPT in the main directory and run CompleteModelML.ipynb all Cells. 

Models.ipynb has the plots for the scattering plots.

if you use mac change cuda to mps and if not use cuda
